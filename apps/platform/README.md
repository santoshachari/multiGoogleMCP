# Google MCP Platform — web app

Multi-tenant web app that wraps the `multiGoogleMCP` tool core: users sign in
with email + password, connect Google accounts, and hand out scoped agents +
API keys to their AI clients. Built with Next.js (App Router), Prisma +
Postgres, and Auth.js.

Platform login (email + password) is entirely separate from connecting a
Google account (its own OAuth flow requesting Gmail/Calendar/Drive/Chat
scopes) — how a user logs into the app has no bearing on which Google
accounts they've linked.

> **Status: functional end-to-end.** Sign in, connect Google accounts
> (encrypted tokens), create scoped agents, mint API keys, and connect an MCP
> client to the agent's endpoint — all 53 Gmail/Calendar/Drive/Chat tools are
> served, scoped per agent.

## Connecting an MCP client

Each agent is served at a single endpoint, authenticated by one of its API keys:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
Authorization: Bearer mcp_<your-key>
```

The client sees only the tools for services the agent has been granted, and
every call is scoped to the agent's granted accounts at the granted permission.
Pass one of the agent's accessible account addresses as the `email` argument to
each tool (the `initialize` response lists them).

Example Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-google-agent": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer mcp_<your-key>" }
    }
  }
}
```

## One-time setup

1. **Postgres** — a local database must exist. This app is wired to
   `postgresql://santosh@localhost:5432/multigmail`; change `DATABASE_URL` in
   `.env` if yours differs.

2. **Google Web OAuth client** (used only for *connecting Google accounts*,
   not for platform login — separate from the Desktop client the local MCP
   server uses):
   - Google Cloud Console → **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create
     credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application**.
   - Authorized redirect URI:
     `http://localhost:3000/api/connect/google/callback`
   - Paste the client id/secret into `.env` as `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` /
     `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`.
   - Add yourself as a **Test user** on the OAuth consent screen.

   `AUTH_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` are already generated in `.env`.

3. **Install & migrate** (from this directory):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run db:migrate      # creates tables (already applied once)
   ```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev                # http://localhost:3000
```

Open the app, click **Sign up** to create an account (email + password, min
8 characters), and you should land on the dashboard.

> **No password reset flow yet.** A locked-out user has no self-service
> recovery — if you forget a password, reset it directly in the database
> (`UPDATE "User" SET "passwordHash" = ...` with a bcrypt hash) until this is
> built.
